The web application

---

How to create a link between Relais & Châteaux and the starred restaurant?

---

⌨️

Server-side with Node.js

---

Create a module called `castle`

---

that returns the list of best rate for all Weekends for each Property

---

```js
const castle = require('castle');
...
const property = {...};


castle.getProperties();
castle.getPrices(property);

...

```

---

1. create the calls (api, http) to get the Property page
1. check if the restaurant is starred.

---

1. get the restaurant name (by scraping or decoding api response)

---

1. get the price by Weekend (by scraping or decoding api response)

etc ...

---

Create a module called `michelin`

---

that returns the list of starred restaurants

---

```js
const michelin = require('michelin');

michelin.get();
```

---

1. scrape list of France located starred restaurants

---

1. store the list into JSON file, nosql database (like redis, mongodb...)

---

1. create a node module that returns this list

etc...

---

Client-side with React
